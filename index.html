                <td rowspan="2"><p>I am a car enthusiast since before I learned to walk, I had a collection of toy trucks and cars that no one at my age would have ever owned. 
                    I took the love of cars from my dad as I grew up talking about cars, engines and new car technologies with him all the time everyday.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes I even had car knowledge competitions with my dad, I will not lie, he used to win but not until I got access to internet and started watching car Vlogs all the time.
                        One of my favorite hangouts was to go to car showrooms and take super cars on a test drive with my dad. We always paid attention to the tiniest details in new cars, 
                        my dad often paid more attention into luxury and technology while I cared more about horsepower, exhaust sounds and <strong>SPEED</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>I got my license in August 2020, but I am not going to hide this secret from you, I have been driving way before that!</p>
                    <p>When I got my license, I had to take one of the family's cars. My friends called it old, looks like a mom's car, but for me its a beast on 4 wheels!</p>
                <h4>My Car is a Black Nissan Pathfinder SE 2005</h4>          
                <p>With a V6 3.5L engine and 285 horsepower. It goes from 0 to 100 KM/H in 8.2 seconds! Quiet astonishing right?!</p>
               <p> It is very useful when picking up my friends or going on picnics and desert camps, specially for its strong 4x4 capabilities.
            </p>
        <p>This car belongs to the <a href="#SUV">SUVs</a> category, its a japanese brand. Nissan company itself said that this is the last successfull Pathfinder produced by them!</p></td>
