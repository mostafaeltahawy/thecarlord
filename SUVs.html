        <p>SUVs is new into the market, did not appear until the late 20th century but they are quite an innovation!
        It is built as a rugged vehicle for cargo and passenger carrying. Originally SUVs were not designed to be fuel efficient but modern designs are getting better fuel mileage.
        The main purpose of SUVs was for the travelling and safaris in deserts or forests. Thats for they are high from the ground and have bigger wheels, which makes it better in those heavy duty missions.
        With time SUVs split into types aswell, nowadays there is the full heavy duty SUVs and the effecient family SUVs.</p>
        <p>In the late 2000s, all car companies started creating SUVs due to the increase in gas prices and the need for effecient cars.
        For further effeciency, few car brands created Vans which are pure family cars. They have huge storage and seating spaces, but very low performance, because what else would a family want?</p>
